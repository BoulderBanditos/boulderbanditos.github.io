# boulderbanditos.github.io
Our project, titled CU Sprint, is a Unity game designed around platforming across the CU Boulder campus. 
It consists of six levels, each representing a different campus building. 
The project is implemented using the Heroku application, complete with a user registration system. 
Hosted at cusprint.herokuapp.com, the website for our application contains an introductory section, the game itself, a blog, 
and the link to our Github page, where our source code can be found along with each individual commit.
The github repository is named Boulder Banditos after the name that we created for our team.
